# votingEngProject
This project aims to demonstrate the methods and technologies available to
implement e-voting within the United Kingdom general elections. This will
consist of two seperate systems, one programmed in Java to handle election
administration, and another system using HTML, CSS and PHP to allow a person
to vote in an election.

## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes 
on how to deploy the project on a live system.


The program will require a virtual server, such as XAMPP, which will host the
database used in the systems.

### Prerequisites


To run the program, an appropriate web server, such as XAMPP, to host the database 
needed for the systems to work. Once downloaded, copy and paste the SQL code
onto the virtual server, so to set up the database the systems will use.



### Installing


Before starting, download a web server, as specificed in prerequisites. Once
downloaded, enter the SQL code in the project, which will create the database to
be used. When this SQL has been run, test the database to ensure SQL was successful,
collecting users from the database, with the following line:

```Select * from voter
```
